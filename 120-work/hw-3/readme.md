["Hello World" Sketch](https://spkvfx.github.io/creative_coding-work/120-work/hw-3/)

---

Within Webstorm I copied the empty example and renamed it HW-3. I then proceeded to edit the sketch.js file.

I had some issues getting the text to appear initially, so i tried a few things including changing the font size. That seemed to fix the problem.

I think ultimately I forgot to add linebreak semicolons. I am finding that it's hard to predict when this error will actually cause a problem. Sometimes things will work, even if the line is not terminated properly.

In Processing, Java, C and VEX, the whole thing will throw up, but it seems in Javascript is a bit more forgiving, but only sometimes. 

I'm sure it's not quite as random as my impressions make it out to be, I'm guessing that the script will just sort of puke the moment there is an unterminated line? IDK.

I'm still not totally sure how to debug. I know that Webstorm does have some debugging capabilities, though, since it will report code issues upon push. I need to figure out how to use this feature on demand.

I was able to offer help to some of the other students, one general question about installing p5.js and another concerning default applications in Windows.
